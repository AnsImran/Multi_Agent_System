There did not happen to be a photon around at the time\\nthe electron went through.\\nThis is all a little discouraging. If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron\\nwe see the same-sized ﬂash, then those electrons we see are always the disturbed\\nones. Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway. Now whenever we\\nhear a click in the detector we will keep a count in three columns: in Column (1)\\nthose electrons seen by hole 1, in Column (2) those electrons seen by hole 2,\\nand in Column (3) those electrons not seen at all. When we work up our data\\n(computing the probabilities) we ﬁnd these results: Those “seen by hole 1” have\\na distribution like P ′\\n1; those “seen by hole 2” have a distribution like P ′\\n2 (so that\\nthose “seen by either hole 1 or 2” have a distribution like P ′\\n12); and those “not\\nseen at all” have a “wavy” distribution just like P12 of Fig. 1-3! If the electrons\\nare not seen, we have interference!\\nThat is understandable. When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs\\nit, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it. There is always the same\\namount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized\\neﬀects and the eﬀect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any\\ninterference eﬀect.\\nIs there not some way we can see the electrons without disturbing them?\\nWe learned in an earlier chapter that the momentum carried by a “photon” is\\ninversely proportional to its wavelength (p = h/λ). Certainly the jolt given\\nto the electron when the photon is scattered toward our eye depends on the\\nmomentum that photon carries. Aha! If we want to disturb the electrons only\\nslightly we should not have lowered the intensity of the light, we should have\\nlowered its frequency (the same as increasing its wavelength). Let us use light of\\na redder color. We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and\\n“see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see”\\nlight of these longer wavelengths. If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid\\ndisturbing the electrons so much.\\nLet us try the experiment with longer waves. We shall keep repeating our\\nexperiment, each time with light of a longer wavelength. At ﬁrst, nothing seems to\\nchange. The results are the same. Then a terrible thing happens. You remember\\nthat when we discussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the wave\\nnature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still\\nbe seen as two separate spots. This distance is of the order of the wavelength of\\nlight. So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between\\nour holes, we see a big fuzzy ﬂash when the light is scattered by the electrons.\\n1-13'), Document(metadata={'subject': 'Physics', 'book_name': 'The Feynman Lectures on Physics - Vol 3 - Quantum Mechanics', 'word_count': 514, 'author_name': 'Richard Feynman', 'page_number': 32, 'sub_subject': 'Quantum Mechanics'}, page_content='makes circular waves. To the right of the source we have again a wall with two\\nholes, and beyond that is a second wall, which, to keep things simple, is an\\n“absorber,” so that there is no reﬂection of the waves that arrive there. This can\\nbe done by building a gradual sand “beach.” In front of the beach we place a\\ndetector which can be moved back and forth in the x-direction, as before. The\\ndetector is now a device which measures the “intensity” of the wave motion. You\\ncan imagine a gadget which measures the height of the wave motion, but whose\\nscale is calibrated in proportion to the square of the actual height, so that the\\nreading is proportional to the intensity of the wave. Our detector reads, then, in\\nproportion to the energy being carried by the wave—or rather, the rate at which\\nenergy is carried to the detector.\\nWith our wave apparatus, the ﬁrst thing to notice is that the intensity can have\\nany size. If the source just moves a very small amount, then there is just a little bit\\nof wave motion at the detector. When there is more motion at the source, there\\nis more intensity at the detector. The intensity of the wave can have any value\\nat all. We would not say that there was any “lumpiness” in the wave intensity.\\nNow let us measure the wave intensity for various values of x (keeping the\\nwave source operating always in the same way). We get the interesting-looking\\ncurve marked I12 in part (c) of the ﬁgure.\\nWe have already worked out how such patterns can come about when we\\nstudied the interference of electric waves in Volume I. In this case we would\\nobserve that the original wave is diﬀracted at the holes, and new circular waves\\nspread out from each hole. If we cover one hole at a time and measure the\\nintensity distribution at the absorber we ﬁnd the rather simple intensity curves\\nshown in part (b) of the ﬁgure. I1 is the intensity of the wave from hole 1 (which\\nwe ﬁnd by measuring when hole 2 is blocked oﬀ) and I2 is the intensity of the\\nwave from hole 2 (seen when hole 1 is blocked).\\nThe intensity I12 observed when both holes are open is certainly not the sum\\nof I1 and I2. We say that there is “interference” of the two waves. At some places\\n(where the curve I12 has its maxima) the waves are “in phase” and the wave\\npeaks add together to give a large amplitude and, therefore, a large intensity.\\nWe say that the two waves are “interfering constructively” at such places. There\\nwill be such constructive interference wherever the distance from the detector to\\none hole is a whole number of wavelengths larger (or shorter) than the distance\\nfrom the detector to the other hole.\\nAt those places where the two waves arrive at the detector with a phase\\ndiﬀerence of π (where they are “out of phase”) the resulting wave motion at\\n1-5'), Document(metadata={'subject': 'Physics', 'book_name': 'The Feynman Lectures on Physics - Vol 3 - Quantum Mechanics', 'word_count': 528, 'author_name': 'Richard Feynman', 'page_number': 39, 'sub_subject': 'Quantum Mechanics'}, page_content='expect them to come through. Whether the holes are closed or open, those which\\nwe see come through hole 1 are distributed in the same way whether hole 2 is\\nopen or closed.\\nBut wait! What do we have now for the total probability, the probability\\nthat an electron will arrive at the detector by any route? We already have that\\ninformation. We just pretend that we never looked at the light ﬂashes, and we\\nlump together the detector clicks which we have separated into the two columns.\\nWe must just add the numbers. For the probability that an electron will arrive\\nat the backstop by passing through either hole, we do ﬁnd P ′\\n12 = P ′\\n1 + P ′\\n2. That\\nis, although we succeeded in watching which hole our electrons come through,\\nwe no longer get the old interference curve P12, but a new one, P ′\\n12, showing no\\ninterference! If we turn out the light P12 is restored.\\nWe must conclude that when we look at the electrons the distribution of them\\non the screen is diﬀerent than when we do not look. Perhaps it is turning on\\nour light source that disturbs things? It must be that the electrons are very\\ndelicate, and the light, when it scatters oﬀthe electrons, gives them a jolt that\\nchanges their motion. We know that the electric ﬁeld of the light acting on a\\ncharge will exert a force on it. So perhaps we should expect the motion to be\\nchanged. Anyway, the light exerts a big inﬂuence on the electrons. By trying to\\n“watch” the electrons we have changed their motions. That is, the jolt given to\\nthe electron when the photon is scattered by it is such as to change the electron’s\\nmotion enough so that if it might have gone to where P12 was at a maximum it\\nwill instead land where P12 was a minimum; that is why we no longer see the\\nwavy interference eﬀects.\\nYou may be thinking: “Don’t use such a bright source! Turn the brightness\\ndown! The light waves will then be weaker and will not disturb the electrons so\\nmuch. Surely, by making the light dimmer and dimmer, eventually the wave will\\nbe weak enough that it will have a negligible eﬀect.” O.K. Let’s try it. The ﬁrst\\nthing we observe is that the ﬂashes of light scattered from the electrons as they\\npass by does not get weaker. It is always the same-sized ﬂash. The only thing\\nthat happens as the light is made dimmer is that sometimes we hear a “click”\\nfrom the detector but see no ﬂash at all. The electron has gone by without being\\n“seen.” What we are observing is that light also acts like electrons, we knew that\\nit was “wavy,” but now we ﬁnd that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is\\nscattered—in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the intensity of\\nthe light source we do not change the size of the photons, only the rate at which\\nthey are emitted.

We expect such low\\nvalues wherever the distance between hole 1 and the detector is diﬀerent from the\\ndistance between hole 2 and the detector by an odd number of half-wavelengths.\\nThe low values of I12 in Fig. 1-2 correspond to the places where the two waves\\ninterfere destructively.\\nYou will remember that the quantitative relationship between I1, I2, and I12\\ncan be expressed in the following way: The instantaneous height of the water\\nwave at the detector for the wave from hole 1 can be written as (the real part\\nof) h1eiωt, where the “amplitude” h1 is, in general, a complex number. The\\nintensity is proportional to the mean squared height or, when we use the complex\\nnumbers, to the absolute value squared |h1|2. Similarly, for hole 2 the height\\nis h2eiωt and the intensity is proportional to |h2|2. When both holes are open,\\nthe wave heights add to give the height (h1 + h2)eiωt and the intensity |h1 + h2|2.\\nOmitting the constant of proportionality for our present purposes, the proper\\nrelations for interfering waves are\\nI1 = |h1|2,\\nI2 = |h2|2,\\nI12 = |h1 + h2|2.\\n(1.2)\\nYou will notice that the result is quite diﬀerent from that obtained with\\nbullets (Eq. 1.1).

We make an electron gun which consists of a tungsten wire\\nheated by an electric current and surrounded by a metal box with a hole in it.

But there are a\\nlarge number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature does work this way.\\nWe would like to illustrate some of these subtleties for you now. First, since the\\nnumber that arrives at a particular point is not equal to the number that arrives\\nthrough 1 plus the number that arrives through 2, as we would have concluded\\nfrom Proposition A, undoubtedly we should conclude that Proposition A is false.\\nIt is not true that the electrons go either through hole 1 or hole 2.

To our electron apparatus we\\nadd a very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two holes,\\nas shown in Fig. 1-4. We know that electric charges scatter light. So when an\\nelectron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scatter\\nsome light to our eye, and we can see where the electron goes. If, for instance, an\\nelectron were to take the path via hole 2 that is sketched in Fig. 1-4, we should\\nsee a ﬂash of light coming from the vicinity of the place marked A in the ﬁgure. If\\nan electron passes through hole 1, we would expect to see a ﬂash from the vicinity\\nof the upper hole. If it should happen that we get light from both places at the\\nsame time, because the electron divides in half . . .

The waves “interfere\\ndestructively,” and we get a low value for the wave intensity. We expect such low\\nvalues wherever the distance between hole 1 and the detector is diﬀerent from the\\ndistance between hole 2 and the detector by an odd number of half-wavelengths.\\nThe low values of I12 in Fig. 1-2 correspond to the places where the two waves\\ninterfere destructively.\\nYou will remember that the quantitative relationship between I1, I2, and I12\\ncan be expressed in the following way: The instantaneous height of the water\\nwave at the detector for the wave from hole 1 can be written as (the real part\\nof) h1eiωt, where the “amplitude” h1 is, in general, a complex number. The\\nintensity is proportional to the mean squared height or, when we use the complex\\nnumbers, to the absolute value squared |h1|2. Similarly, for hole 2 the height\\nis h2eiωt and the intensity is proportional to |h2|2. When both holes are open,\\nthe wave heights add to give the height (h1 + h2)eiωt and the intensity |h1 + h2|2.\\nOmitting the constant of proportionality for our present purposes, the proper\\nrelations for interfering waves are\\nI1 = |h1|2,\\nI2 = |h2|2,\\nI12 = |h1 + h2|2.\\n(1.2)\\nYou will notice that the result is quite diﬀerent from that obtained with\\nbullets (Eq. 1.1). If we expand |h1 + h2|2 we see that\\n|h1 + h2|2 = |h1|2 + |h2|2 + 2|h1||h2| cos δ,\\n(1.3)\\nwhere δ is the phase diﬀerence between h1 and h2. In terms of the intensities,\\nwe could write\\nI12 = I1 + I2 + 2\\np\\nI1I2 cos δ.\\n(1.4)\\nThe last term in (1.4) is the “interference term.” So much for water waves.

We make an electron gun which consists of a tungsten wire\\nheated by an electric current and surrounded by a metal box with a hole in it. If\\nthe wire is at a negative voltage with respect to the box, electrons emitted by\\nthe wire will be accelerated toward the walls and some will pass through the hole.\\n1-6'),\n",

(It is hard to see how one could get\\nsuch a simple result from a complicated game of electrons going back and forth\\nthrough the plate on some strange trajectory.)\\nWe conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like particles, and\\nthe probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed like the distribution of\\nintensity of a wave. It is in this sense that an electron behaves “sometimes like a\\nparticle and sometimes like a wave.”\\nIncidentally, when we were dealing with classical waves we deﬁned the intensity\\nas the mean over time of the square of the wave amplitude, and we used complex\\nnumbers as a mathematical trick to simplify the analysis.\\nBut in quantum\\nmechanics it turns out that the amplitudes must be represented by complex\\nnumbers. The real parts alone will not do. That is a technical point, for the\\nmoment, because the formulas look just the same.\\nSince the probability of arrival through both holes is given so simply, although\\nit is not equal to (P1 + P2), that is really all there is to say. But there are a\\nlarge number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature does work this way.\\nWe would like to illustrate some of these subtleties for you now. First, since the\\nnumber that arrives at a particular point is not equal to the number that arrives\\nthrough 1 plus the number that arrives through 2, as we would have concluded\\nfrom Proposition A, undoubtedly we should conclude that Proposition A is false.\\nIt is not true that the electrons go either through hole 1 or hole 2.

To our electron apparatus we\\nadd a very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two holes,\\nas shown in Fig. 1-4. We know that electric charges scatter light. So when an\\nelectron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scatter\\nsome light to our eye, and we can see where the electron goes. If, for instance, an\\nelectron were to take the path via hole 2 that is sketched in Fig. 1-4, we should\\nsee a ﬂash of light coming from the vicinity of the place marked A in the ﬁgure. If\\nan electron passes through hole 1, we would expect to see a ﬂash from the vicinity\\nof the upper hole. If it should happen that we get light from both places at the\\nsame time, because the electron divides in half . . . Let us just do the experiment!\\nHere is what we see: every time that we hear a “click” from our electron\\ndetector (at the backstop), we also see a ﬂash of light either near hole 1 or near\\n1-10'),\n",

If one looks at the holes or, more accurately, if one has a piece of\\napparatus which is capable of determining whether the electrons go through\\nhole 1 or hole 2, then one can say that it goes either through hole 1 or hole 2.
